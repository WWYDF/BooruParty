# DATABASE_URL: Your PostgreSQL connection information
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL: The PUBLICLY accessible version of your site. If you are using a reverse proxy, put that here.
# NEXT_PUBLIC_FASTIFY: The PUBLICLY accessible version of your Fastify. If you are using a reverse proxy, put that here.
# NEXTAUTH_SECRET: The text used to hash user data. You can use whatever you want (avoid symbols), but in testing we use UUIDv4.
# NEXTAUTH_URL: Just set this to be the same as NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL.
# GUEST_VIEWING: Should non-logged-in users be allowed to view posts, users, etc.?
# REGISTRATION: Should anyone be allowed to make a new account for themselves?
# NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_NAME: The site name, call this whatever you want.
# INTERNAL_API_SECRET: This is a string used in exchange with inter-server processes. Set to a random UUIDv4 string.

# It is extremely important to make sure you set all of these. Especially the SECRETs!
